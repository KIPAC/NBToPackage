# Software goals, questions and answers


## 1. How much do we care about reproducibility?  Would we like to be able to remake the identical plots in two years if needed?

To be honest, this is kinda aspirational, but yeah, it would be cool.


## 2. Related, but slightly different question, how much do we care about "provenance tracking", i.e., knowing which data and software version were used to make a particular plot?

This would be super useful.  Worth putting a bit of effort into.


## 3. How much configurability do we want in the plots?  Are we going to be trying out a bunch of different versions of the plots?

Probably yes, let's keep our options open.


## 4. How much do we care about consistency in things like axis ranges, axis labels, data selection criteria, etc...?

Personally I care a lot, it takes forever getting all this stuff right when you are submitting a paper.  Making it easier would be great.


## 5. Plots that are formatted for papers tend to not look great in talks, do we want a simple switch to make the same plots, but formatted for talks?

That would be pretty cool.
