# Software goals, questions and answers


## 1. How much do we care about reproducibility?  Would we like to be able to remake the identical plots in two years if needed?


## 2. Related, but slightly different question, how much do we care about "provenance tracking", i.e., knowing which data and software version were used to make a particular plot?


## 3. How much configurability do we want in the plots?  Are we going to be trying out a bunch of different versions of the plots?


## 4. How much do we care about consistency in things like axis ranges, axis labels, data selection criteria, etc...?


## 5. Plots that are formatted for papers tend to not look great in talks, do we want a simple switch to make the same plots, but formatted for talks?
