# Moving from jupyter notebook to a python package

We are going to be spending about and hour and a half working through how we might design code 
as a python package rather than as a jupyter notebook.

We are going to be working from a concrete example, but, given the time available, we will have to 
focus on big-picture points.

## Objectives and content

The objectives here are pretty simple
 
  1. understand the advantages moving from a jupyter-notebook analysis to a python package,
  2. understand how to design a really nice python package,
  3. understand how to build a really nice python package, a to get a sense of the tools available to help with that.

To reach these objectives we are going to break this down as follows

  1. start with a pretty typical notebook that makes a bunch of plots for a paper, and characterize what the notebook is doing,
  2. rethink what we want from the software, 
  3. come up with some design that gets us more of what we want,
  4. look at an example implemenation of a python package that replaces the original notebook and see how it address what we came up with in 2,3,4 and 5.
