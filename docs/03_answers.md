# Software design, questions and answers


## 1. What is the basic unit that we are going to work with?  A function that makes a single plot?  Several plots?


## 2. How are we going to want to keep that of the plots we've made?  What bit of software knows about all the plots we've made?


## 3. How do we handle the balance between configurability and reproducibility?  How do we keep track of how a particular plot was made?


## 4. How do we manage common parameters?


## 5. Do we want a command-line tool?  What options and arguments should it take?
