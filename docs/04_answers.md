# Software implemenation, questions and answers

## 1. Having a separate class for every single plot seems like a bit of overkill, what are we gaining by doing things this way?


## 2. The plot-specific function `_make_plot(self, cat)` function only take one argument, namely the input catalog, but the function the user sees `__call__(self, cat, **kwargs)` takes any number of argument through the `**kwargs` mechanism.  Why is this useful? 


## 3. What do we get from having the `PlotConfig` class?


## 4. What do we get from having the `PlotCollection` class?


## 5. What did we come up with for dealing with common parameters?


## 6. What is your overall take on the final package?
