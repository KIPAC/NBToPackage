# Starting with the original notebook

Please have a look at the [original notebook](../nb/orig_nb.ipynb)

Some questions for discussion:

1. What is the notebook doing?
2. How much redundancy / code duplication in the notebook that could be reduced?
3. What things are we are doing that make it less that ideal to be
   using a notebook?  Why?
4. How easy would it be to come back to this notebook in a year and
   expand on it?  Why?
5. How easy would it be to hand this notebook off to someone else?  Why?

Let's take about 10' to come up with _brief_ answers to these questions.

For what it's worth, here is [my take on those questions](01_answers.md)
