# Starting with the original notebook

Please have a look at the (original notebook)[../nb/orig_nb.ipynb]

Some questions for discussion:

1. What is the notebook doing?
2. Is there a lot of redundancy / code duplication in the notebook that could be reduced?  
3. Are there things about what we are doing that make it less that ideal to be using a notebook?
4. Would it be easy to come back to this notebook in a year and expand on it?
5. Would it be easy to hand this notebook off to someone else?

For what it's worth, here is [my take on those questions](01_answers.md)
