# Designing our software

Take some time to discuss these questions. 

1. What is the basic unit that we are going to work with?  A function that makes a single plot?  Several plots?
2. How are we going to want to keep that of the plots we've made?  What bit of software knows about all the plots we've made?
3. How do we handle the balance between configurability and reproducibility?  How do we keep track of how a particular plot was made?
4. How do we manage common parameters?
5. Do we want a command-line tool?  What options and arguments should it take?

Let's take about 10' to come up with _brief_ answers to these questions.

For what it's worth, here is [my take on those questions](03_answers.md)
